# MicroService: Resturcturing my Job Application from Monolithic architecture to MicroService.

## ``` How I am going to structure my three microservice ```
![Port](image-1.png)

    I have 3 different microservice running on 3 different ports, We can see in the above image.

    These 3 microservices are going to 3 different springboot projects.

``` Why so? ```

    we are going to break down a single application which is in
    monolithic architecture into 3 different parts and they will
    be responsible for running as a single application. So for 
    the end user it will be like they are interacting a single
    application but in backend I have 3 different microservices
    running on 3 different ports
